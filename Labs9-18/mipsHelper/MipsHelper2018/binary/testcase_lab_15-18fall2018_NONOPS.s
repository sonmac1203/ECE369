# Description:
#   * you are supporting memory operations, branches and jumps.
#   * You need to prepare both your InstructionMemory and DataMemory.
#   * Instructions tested: beq, bgez, bgtz, bltz, bne, j, jal, jr, lw, sw
#   * Your can run this program in QtSpim if you are not clear what this program does.
#   * Note: This program is an infinite loop.

# Initialize your DataMemory first as the following:
# Memory[1] <= 32'h00000001;
# Memory[2] <= 32'hffffffff;
# Memory[*] <= 0, where * represents all the other indexes other than 1 and 2

# Initialize your InstructionMemory with the instructions in the program.
# Translation process is similar to that of Lab10-11


# An example instruction translation for a jump instruction is as follow:
# j start (Where "start" is a label that your target to jump to)
# OpCode [31 : 26]      Instruction_Index [25 : 0]
# 000010                0 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 1100
# The next instruction will be executed is InstructionMemory[12].

# Your target is an index/address to your instruction memory.
# In other word, jump target will update the program counter to a "target" value, and the 
# next instruction executed will be the "target" instead of the default "previous + 4"

# For branch:
# beq       $s0, $zero, branch1 (Where branch1 is a label represents the offset value from current PC)
# OpCode [31 : 26]    rs [25 : 21]     rt[20 : 16]      offset[15 : 0]
# 000100              10000            00000            0000 0000 0000 1000
# if ($s0 == $zero) -> branch to (current_PC + offset)
# The value of offset is determined by how you initialize your InstructionMemory.
