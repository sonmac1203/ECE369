# Exercise 2
#  Max Score: 15 points
#
# Students: 
#
# 'count_occurence.a' - count the occurrences of a specific character in string 
# "str". Indexed addressing is used to access the array elements.
#  MAX Score: 15 points
# Expected Outcome:- 
# The following string will be printed on the console,
# "Count is 6"
#
# Questions:-
# 1. Briefly describe the purposes of the registers, $t0, $t1, $t2, and $t3.
# 2. Currently, the program is stuck in an infinite loop. Make use of 
#    breakpoints to locate, and correct the error.
